This is the source code of my personal website.

It was orignally built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but has been ported to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) & [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). It uses [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) for the typing effect on the logo. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
